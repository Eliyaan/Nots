gates (saveable but via another system)

save system


buttons (keyboard + click)
levers because nice

1, 2, 3, 4 to select the item to place
ctrl + Z
cut/copy/paste
speed control buttons



very bad perf when lot of the screen covered by drawing -> replace only what needs to be replaced ?
fix all the drawing issues + gnome issues
replace select item menu icons with b&w & semitransparent icons (graphics era)

// Rules to remember:
Not state updated before queuing them
Junctions not in wire outputs
Junctions not queued just loop till other side
