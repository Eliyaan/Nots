diff skins for junctions depending on state + placing skins     

diodes

select obj bar, a gray alpha rect + images & light gray square for the selected one (right side)    

gates (saveable but via another system)

save system


buttons (keyboard + click)
levers because nice

ctrl + Z
cut/copy/paste


very bad perf when lot of the screen covered by drawing -> replace only what needs to be replaced ?
fix all the drawing issues + gnome issues

// Rules to remember:
Not state updated before queuing them
Junctions not in wire outputs
Junctions not queued just loop till other side
